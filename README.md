# Cyber Security Internship - Task 2

## 🎯 Objective:

Analyze a suspicious email and identify phishing indicators used by attackers.

---

## 📧 Phishing Email Overview:

* **From:** "Wells Fargo" (appears legit)
* **Subject:** "Secure Your WellsFargo Online Key"
* **Body Message:** Asks user to click a link to “reactivate” a security key
* **Link:** `http://cabinetkigmina.com/Wellsfargo_keys_account8/page2.html`

---

## 🔍 Phishing Indicators Found:

1. **Fake Link**

   * Looks like a Wells Fargo link, but actually goes to `cabinetkigmina.com` — clearly not a bank website.

2. **Urgency**

   * Uses fear tactics: “Your Personal Security Key has expired.”

3. **No Personal Greeting**

   * Uses "Dear Alex" but no other account info — real banks use your full name.

4. **Unusual Sender**

   * Sender claims to be “Wells Fargo Support” but LinkedIn inbox is being used — not standard for banks.

5. **Brand Misuse**

   * Uses Wells Fargo name and style to create trust — typical of phishing.

---

## 🔐 Why It's Dangerous:

* Clicking the link may lead to a **fake login page** that steals passwords.
* May download malware or steal personal data.

---

## 🛠 Tools/Methods Used:

* Manual inspection of email content and sender
* Hovered over links to check real destination

## ✅ Conclusion:

This is a **clear phishing attempt**. It uses urgent language, fake branding, and a misleading link to trick the user into giving up sensitive info.
⚠️ Always check the real link before clicking, and don’t trust urgent emails without verification.
