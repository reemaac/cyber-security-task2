# Cyber Security Internship - Task 2

## 🎯 Objective:

Analyze a suspicious email and identify phishing indicators used by attackers.

---

## 📧 Phishing Email Overview:

- **From:** "Wells Fargo" (appears legit)
- **Subject:** "Secure Your WellsFargo Online Key"
- **Body Message:** Asks user to click a link to “reactivate” a security key
- **Link:** `http://cabinetkigmina.com/Wellsfargo_keys_account8/page2.html`

---

## 🔍 Phishing Indicators Found:

1. **Fake Link**  
   - The displayed text looks official, but the real link goes to `cabinetkigmina.com` — not a bank website.

2. **Urgent Language**  
   - “Your Personal Security Key has expired.” — creates panic to make you click quickly.

3. **Generic Greeting**  
   - Uses "Dear Alex" — banks usually use your full legal name.

4. **Unusual Sender Platform**  
   - The email comes via LinkedIn inbox, not from a bank's official domain.

5. **Misused Branding**  
   - Attempts to copy Wells Fargo’s style but uses inconsistent fonts and layout.

---

## 🔐 Why It’s Dangerous:

- The fake link could steal login credentials (phishing).
- May install malware or redirect to fake login sites.
- Social engineering is used to trick the user emotionally.

---

## 🛠 Tools/Methods Used:

- Manual inspection of email content
- Hovered over the email link to view the true URL
